# My Reflection 



As a 19-year-old university student, I enrolled in an introductory course in digital humanities, in hopes of widening my field of studies. One major difference that this class has as opposed to my other classes is the plethora of students from different majors that enrolled in this class. These majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. What’s unique with this is the opportunity to learn from each student’s unique take, based on their chosen discipline, when applied to digital humanities. Each person’s unique skill set help us build a better understanding of what digital literacy means. 

Before immersing ourselves in the world of digital humanities, we had already developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics. As a Computer Science major, I am developing my skills in coding languages such as Python and C++, in hopes of utilizing them for content creation, software development, and data manipulation. My academic journey has just begun and I have been exploring through platforms like GitHub, in hopes of understanding and refining my problem solving skills, algorithm design, etc. 

My peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing had their own digital toolkits. Interactive Media students excelled in user-centered design and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Film and New Media enthusiasts delved into multimedia production and digital narrative creation. Environmental Studies majors leveraged data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students honed their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dived deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.

However, the digital humanities course has allowed students from various disciplines to intersect and offer our unique skill sets. Content creation, once thought to be confined to specific fields, took on a multidisciplinary dimension. We explored creating interactive websites, digital art installations, immersive narratives, and AI-generated content. Our collaborative efforts showcased the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, blurring the lines between art, science, and storytelling. Through our assignment 1, we were able to explore both the [Ham Website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), and API tools that the museum offered. This assignment helped bridge the gap between art, data, and computer science. Through the APIs, we were able to analyze data about the different art pieces in the collection of the Harvard Art Museum, which allowed us to build connections between different pieces of art within the collection. 

Social interaction and collaboration also evolved. Platforms like Slack, Discord, and even online forums like reddit became hubs for exchanging ideas, sparking discussions, and collaborating on projects. These online forums allowed for another way of interdisciplinary communication, where people from different backgrounds are able to voice their take on different ideas. We found ourselves engaging in thought-provoking conversations that spanned our areas of expertise, enriching our perspectives and generating innovative ideas. Collaborating across disciplines proved to be a catalyst for creativity and interdisciplinary thinking.

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like Zotero and Omeka became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. The importance of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age. In assignment 3, we were able to use geocoding and web-based programs like [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl), which helped with visualizing data on a map. Another example where we were able to use tools to help with data visualizaton was through orange data mining. It is useful to help us identity trends and connections between images that we may not be able to determine with our naked eye. 

Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of “computational thinking” in the age of AI. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. As AI continues to shape our world, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making. 

Digital humanities has broadened our horizons, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Environmental Studies majors explored AI’s potential in climate change monitoring, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.  AI is scary to many of us, claiming to take our place in academia, the workplace and beyond. However, they lack an important aspect of humans, creativity. AI shouldn’t be used to replace our work, but instead, enhance and simplify our workflow. One example where we utilized AI to simplify our workflow was creating a word cloud through chatGPT. Another way we were shown in the class to have used GPT to help simplify a workflow was this video :[ “ Experiments Using ChatGPT With Archival Collections”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X4kaiFPXz4), where ChatGPT was used to tag writing, and help grouping related works. What ChatGPT struggled here with was what I mentioned earlier, creativity. ChatGPT was not well trained in creative writing, and could not properly follow the prompt given when asked to do creative writing, no matter how specific the prompt was. Understanding this, we need to learn to utilize what AI is good at and know what the struggle at so that we can enhance our workflow, since it’s undeniable that these tools are going to disappear. 

Our final unproject also helped me understand how AI could be possibily utilized in the future. For my own unproject, we hoped for the use of AI to analyze virality, which could be a very tedious task if done completely manually, or maybe even impossible. Projects from my classmates also reinforced my support to integrate more AI into our usages in life. I believe that learning to work with AI is the move forward with all fields. 

Through this class as a whole, I was also able to learn about the various tools people have coded and developed that are free to use on the web, such as the above mentioned kepler.gl and orange data mining. I was also able to learn about the emerging art of digital humanities. In the beginning of the class, I believed digital humanites to just be the publication of humanities work on the Internet. I have since learnt that with the inclusion of computers and the internet into humanities, we are able to increase engagement of our audience throgh various ways of visualization and formatting that were previously impossible in the world of humanities. I want to further improve this skill of polishing my work that are published on the web, utilizing more of the various advantages both the computer and AI has to offer.  

Looking ahead, we are excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working. We aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world. We envision a future where collaboration between artists, scientists, scholars, and creators becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields.

In conclusion, our journey through digital humanities has been transformative. It has expanded our horizons, bridged the gap between technology and the humanities, and equipped us with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, we are poised to embrace new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, we are ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Ready to Grade.
