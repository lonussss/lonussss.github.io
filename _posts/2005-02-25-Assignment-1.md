# **Part 1**

*HAM Website:*
The website is easy to navigate, and has a simple user interface. By using generous interfaces, users get to scroll and explore through the collections without having to have a particular piece in mind to search for. The visuals help play a part in intriguing users and capturing their attention without actively trying to search for something. Users are also able to filter pieces by classification, work type, medium, technique, period, place, century, culture, and/or gallery. There are also many subcategories within each filter, making it a lot easier for people to search for a specific type of work. We found it to be relatively accessible because the pictures and fonts were a decent size and in a font/color that is easy to read. 

The piece that caught our attention was: [Chicken Noodle Soup] (https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/262968?position=262968). Through the website, we were able to access related personnels that took part in the creation of the piece. Other information that was available to us through the website were the date of creation, type of art, cultures related to the piece, dimensions, and even physical descriptions of the medium. Two details we found to be interesting were accession year and location. The accession year tells you the year the museum acquired the piece, and the location tells you where the piece is located within the Harvard Art Museum, and users are even able to view the piece’s location on their interactive map. The website is able to provide visuals, title, object number and classification without having to click into the object. 

*CSV:*
The organization of pieces within the CSV files seems more structured when compared to the website, however, we couldn’t distinguish the exact method of grouping that was utilized when creating the csv. The CSV is able to provide more information on each piece of art without the need of accessing specific pieces. The CSV allows you to analyze the metadata much more efficiently through scripts such as the API provided in the positcloud. 

Conclusion:
The website is more user friendly and visually appealing. However, the website is more geared towards the obtainment of data for individual pieces, whereas the CSV allows for a broader analysis of the collection of pieces possessed by the museum. 

#**Part 2**

The culture with by far the most items in the collection is American, this is followed by German, French, Italian, British and Japanese. While there are plenty more cultures within the cultures, the pieces that those cultures possess are far less than the aforementioned cultures. The collection is still majority composed of pieces from western cultures. For our culture, we chose Korean, and the piece that was most viewed according to the Harvard_API_ALL_objects is a vessel with the title “ Large, Broad-Shouldered Jar with Decoration of Two Striding Dragons, Each Pursuing a Flaming Jewel”.  ![Vessel](vessel.jpg) The piece that was the least viewed was a fragment titled“ Sherd: Portion of the Lip of a Vessel, Probably a Jar or Bottle”. ![Fragment](fragment.jpg) The most viewed object is a beautiful jar decorated with a drawing of two dragons, although being a Korean piece, the piece is something that is able to be enjoyed by people from all cultures and backgrounds. On the other hand, the least viewed peace is a fragment, with its origins being unknown as well. The reason why this could be the least view may be because of how unflattering it looks. There is nothing really nothing to grab on to a person’s attention. Without any context, you couldn’t really identify what you are looking at.
